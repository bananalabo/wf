# Bananalabo Localization Script (`jp.js`)

## Overview

This repository contains the `jp.js` script for localizing Webflow websites into Japanese, developed by Bananalabo LLC. The script automatically translates and customizes text elements on your site, improving usability for Japanese audiences.

## Quick Integration

Include the script in your Webflow project by adding the following tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/bananalabo/wf/main/jp.js"></script>
```

## Placement Instructions

Insert the script at the end of the `<body>` section, just before the closing tag (`</body>`), ensuring that all page elements are fully loaded before the script runs.

### Example

```html
<!-- Your site's HTML content -->

<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/bananalabo/wf/main/jp.js"></script>
</body>
```

## Features

* Automatic replacement of specific English strings with their Japanese translations.
* Improved readability and localization for Japanese-speaking users.
* Real-time text updates upon page load.

## Troubleshooting

If translations are not appearing:

* Verify the script tag is included exactly as provided.
* Ensure the script loads correctly by checking network activity.
* Review browser console logs for any script-related errors.
